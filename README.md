# React Express Boilerplate

This is a barebones React app sitting on an ExpressJS server. As is, you can clone and navigate into the project directory, then run `yarn start-dev` or `npm run start-dev` to start developing your new project. In another tab, run `yarn (or "npm run") build --watch` to have Webpack rebundle the project live as it is updated. Run `yarn start` to simply serve up the latest build of your app.

The guide for how to create this project from scratch can be found [here](https://github.com/jefferyshivers/React-Express-Boilerplate). I include the generated `dist/bundle.js` to show the full result of following that guide, but you'll want to remove and add that file to your `.gitignore` for developing your own projects.
